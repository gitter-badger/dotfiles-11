1. add irb config set irb to default to simple.. or maybe just make an alias in bash like irbs = irb --simpleprompt
1. figure out where/how gary bernhardt did his whole window config thing where windows resize automatically.
	- can this be switched on and off with a vim command? http://vim.1045645.n5.nabble.com/winwidth-amp-winheight-doesn-t-work-here-td4884704.html

		=============================================================================
		With me it does, but remember that these options are "desired minimums
		for the current window" and that the "absolute minimums for any window"
		are set by 'winminwidth' and 'winminheight'. When switching windows, the
		new window will not be resized if it already exceeds the desired
		minimum, nor will it be made bigger than would allow all other windows
		to remain at or above the absolute minimum.

		Also, some special window types have their own desired minimums: see
		:help 'helpheight'
		:help 'cmdwinheight'
		:help 'previewheight'

		The absolute minimums may be set to zero, the desired minimum for the
		current window must be at least 1 since the currentcursor location must
		always be visible.

		The following should swell the current window to maximum size, squashing
		other windows to only a vertical divider on left and right or a status
		line above and below:

		:set nowfh                                  " no fixed size
		:set noea eadirection=both                  " no equal size
		:set wmw=0 wmh=0                            " squash other windows
		:set wiw=9999 wh=999 hh=999 cwh=999 pvh=999 " enlarge current window
		:let netrw_winsize = 100                    " netrw split to 100% size
		=============================================================================

2. go through and clean up settings.sh
	- do i need to make a parent process that runs both settings.sh and config?
	- can i map a quick double caps to be escape and still leave single caps as ctrl?
3. remap:
	- uu should undo
	- use smart tabs http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces
4. configure plugins:
	- Command-T
	- nerdtree
	- airline
	- solarized
	- commentary
	- eunuch
	- pathogen
	- repeat
5. Figure out how to make custom help page to list all my mappings.
	- The command to access this information should be ':help me'
	- put vimrc info -- before this, pull from or install vim-unimpared
	- key usage and shortcuts for plugins
6. readme
7. metaprogram a custom dotfiles builder -- in ruby if possible
	- include package installer
8. update configuration script:
	- script should ask if user wants to do all and also give a list of what "all" means
	- if user selects no then the program should walk through each setup task and ask for a y/n
9. Go back through vimrc and make all breaks at 80 instead of 100. PERHAPS undo that line length hack?

- pull some of the best mappings from https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired
- add https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise ?
- go through https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible and pull any desired
	- same with https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease
- install and see the intention results of https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth
- look into installing https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive
	- same with https://github.com/vim-ruby/vim-ruby
