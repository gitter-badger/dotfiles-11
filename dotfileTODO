0. can the vimrc just pull in the important plugins and then call the .vim
folder? if that the case, can I then just break up the vimrc into individual
files? in other words can i have a mappings file and a view file and a commands
file.. things like that
1. add irb config set irb to default to simple.. or maybe just make an alias in bash like irbs = irb --simpleprompt
2. go through and clean up settings.sh
	- do i need to make a parent process that runs both settings.sh and config?
	- can i map a quick double caps to be escape and still leave single caps as ctrl?
3. remap:
	- uu should undo
	- use smart tabs http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Indent_with_tabs,_align_with_spaces
4. configure plugins:
	- Command-T
	- nerdtree
	- airline
	- solarized
	- commentary
	- eunuch
	- pathogen
	- repeat
5. Figure out how to make custom help page to list all my mappings.
	- The command to access this information should be ':help me'
	- put vimrc info -- before this, pull from or install vim-unimpared
	- key usage and shortcuts for plugins
6. readme
7. metaprogram a custom dotfiles builder -- in ruby if possible
	- include package installer
8. update configuration script:
	- script should ask if user wants to do all and also give a list of what "all" means
	- if user selects no then the program should walk through each setup task and ask for a y/n
9. Go back through vimrc and make all breaks at 80 instead of 100. PERHAPS undo that line length hack? 
10. go through thoughtbot additions.
11. check stuff in old directory for any additions browse the net for common or
smart bash shortcuts. organize the bash like vim
12. check profile add to script etc if necessary.
13. find out if there is a way to include files based on system. so debian and
osx etc would have separate files?
14. document the submodule addtition and update and int process on other
machines
15. add shortcut for pi to start and stop vnc sudo /etc/init.d/tightvncserver
start 
16. should i use zsh? http://fendrich.se/blog/2012/09/28/no/
17. markdown plugin?
18. add to config script.. if dotfiles is not located in the ~/ directory then
make a simlink to its actual location from the ~/ directory
19. add 1w mapping to 10w like i did for j k l and h
20. go through old
